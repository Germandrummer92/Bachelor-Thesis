\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:Introduction}

This bachelorthesis will try to formalize the following process: Replacing the abstract notion of the control program in a verified (by \keym) Cyber-Physical-System (\textit{CPS}) with an actual verified (by \key) implementation through a form of Formal Refinement and being able to verify that the entire CPS still satisfys the required safety constraints, using both \keym~and \key. 

CPS are generally modelled as either Hybrid Automata or - Programs.(See ref.~\cite{platzer2010b}). Mostly, this means, that an abstract version of the discrete control program is modelled, as a non-deterministic assignment of one or multiple control value (See app.~\ref{fig:ex_control}). To replace this non-deterministic assignment with an actual implementation a certain ''glue'' or ''coupling'' has to be found to translate discrete and real continous values into each other. Glue in this case refers to a relation that encompasses both the discrete and real values. In certain cases (See chap.~\ref{ch:Watertank:Glue}), glue will be a concrete function, but no in general.

If we try to express the goal of this thesis in logic, we get equation~\ref{eq:Main_LogicRefinement}. Here, \(\psi\) is the safety condition that acts both as a specification for our later implementation and the goal the program result is verified against. Glue is the aforementioned relation to be able to translate from the real into the discrete world and vice versa.

\begin{split}
\textbf{If}~ (\models [ controlValue := \ast, ?\psi(controlValue) \dots] \alpha~\textrm{verified} \\ \wedge \textit{``glue''(discreteVariables, continuousVariables)}~\textrm{verified} \\
\textbf{Then}~ [controlValue := JavaProgram \dots] \alpha~\textrm{also verified}
\end{split}
\label{eq:Main_LogicRefinement}
\end{equation} To explain this process we will take a look at the following: 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\bfseries \Roman*:]

\item Example-based Refinement on CPS Watertank (Example taken from Ke\kern-.2emYmaera).
\item Introduction of formalized process of using Refinement to gain a concrete implementation from a hybrid model.
\item Application of formalized process on example: CPS Gear-Backlash (See ref.~\cite{bla}).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Introducing Cyber-Physical-Systems}
In this thesis we take a close look at \textbf{CPS}. These are systems in which a physical aspect or value is controlled by a computer (program). For example, an aircraft control system in which the computer exerts a form of speed control on the airplane would be a CPS. 

In our case we take a closer look at the closely related notion of \textit{Hybrid Systems}, in which discrete values (in the control program) and continuous values (in the physical world) coexist. The difficulty in analyzing these kinds of systems stems from the ``hybridness'' of the systems: There is always some form of translation necessary to go from the program (discrete values) to the physical (continous reals) world. 

 two basic modelling approaches exist for hybrid systems: Hybrid Automata that are based on Non-Determnistic Finite Automata.

\section{Example: Formula}
One of the nice things about the Linux Libertine font is that it comes with
a math mode package.
\begin{displaymath}
f(x)=\Omega(g(x))\ (x\rightarrow\infty)\;\Leftrightarrow\;
\limsup_{x \to \infty} \left|\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right|> 0
\end{displaymath}
